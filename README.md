# Interval Timer App

An interval timer app that lets users manage custom timers with optional break intervals. The app provides multiple visual clock formats (analog, digital, and text) and allows switching between continuous and paused intervals based on user settings.

## Features

- **Customizable Timer**: Set the initial duration (minutes and seconds) for your timer.
- **Break Functionality**: Option to enable breaks between intervals for recovery or rest periods.
- **Multiple Clock Views**: Seamlessly switch between analog, digital, and text-based clocks.
- **Alerts and Reminders**: Visual alerts notify users when a timer reaches zero.

## Tools and Technologies

- **React**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing to enhance code quality and maintainability.
- **EasyTimer**: Timer management for counting down intervals and handling custom break times.
- **React Router**: Manages route-based navigation within the app.
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool optimized for modern frontend projects.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for a clean, responsive user experience.
